# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
The purpose of project was to implement web scraping techniques to pull information from multiple pages about the planet Mars. I used Chrome Developer tools to identify the HTML components of each web source. I used Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate Google Chrome and perform scraping. I used MongoDB to store my data. I used Flask to display my data. The information scraped included: Current news about Mars, the "Featured Image", facts about the planet, and images of the four hemispheres.
